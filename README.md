# swiper-action
Simple react component for swipe-to-action.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is still in its early stages. If you have ideas for improvements, open an issue or a pull request!

## Idea
Using this library "swipe-to-action" can be implemented easily. The idea is to have a container that contains the content and the actions. The actions are hidden by default and are only shown when the user swipes the content to the left or right. The actions can then be clicked to perform an action.

## üöÄ Getting started
You can install this package using your favorite package manager:

```npm install swiper-action```

There are two components: 
- `SwiperAction`: acts as the outer container for your content.
- `Action`: used for the definition of your "swipe-to-actions" actions. The handler for each action receives an `InteractionEvent` that can either be a `MouseEvent` or a `TouchEvent`.


```jsx
import { SwiperAction, Action } from "swiper-action";

function Example() {
  const actions = [
    <Action action={(e) => handleClick(e)} key={1}>
      <div className="flex h-full flex-col justify-center">
        action
      </div>
    </Action>,
    <Action action={(e) => handleClick(e)} key={2}>
      <div className="flex h-full flex-col justify-center">
        action2
      </div>
    </Action>,
  ];

  return (
    <SwiperAction actions={actions}>
      <div>Content</div>
    </SwiperAction>
  );
}
```

In the end, this should look something like this image:

### Caveats
1. Currently, the `key` prop needs to be set manually for the `Action` component. This will likely be fixed in the future.
2. The width and height of the outer container for the `SwiperAction` component need to be set explicitly.
